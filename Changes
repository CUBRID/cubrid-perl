  First public release of DBD::cubrid module. We provide the basic use to access CUBRID database.

  Supported functions:

  Driver Handle Methods:

    connect - Establishes a database connection

  Database Handle Methods:

    prepare             - Prepares a statement for later execution and returns a reference to a statement handle object.

    rollback            - Roll back the transaction.
    disconnect          - Disconnects the database from the database handle.
    ping                - Check whether the database server is still running and the connection to it is still working.
    last_insert_id      - Returns a value identifying the row just inserted.
    do                  - Prepare and execute a single statement.
    selectrow_array     - This utility method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchrow_array" into a single call.
    selectrow_arrayref  - This utility method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchrow_array" into a single call.
    selectrow_hashref   - This utility method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchrow_array" into a single call.
    selectall_arrayref  - This utility method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchrow_array" into a single call.
    selectall_hashref   - This utility method combines "prepare", "execute" and "fetchrow_array" into a single call.
    selectcol_arrayref  - This utility method combines "prepare", "execute", and fetching one column from all the rows, into a single call.
    table_info          - Returns a list of hash references holding information about one or more variants of datatype.
    tables              - Simple interface to table_info(), returns a list of matching table names.
    column_info         - Returns an active statement handle that can be used to fetch information about columns in specified tables.
    primary_key_info    - Returns an active statement handle that can be used to fetch information about columns that make up the 
                          primary key for a table.
    primary_key         - Simple interface to the primary_key_info() method. Returns a list of the column names that comprise the
                          primary key of the specified table. The list is in primary key column sequence order.
    foreign_key_info    - Returns an active statement handle that can be used to fetch information about foreign keys in and/or 
                          referencing the specified table(s).
    get_info            - Returns information about the implementation, i.e. driver and data source capabilities, restrictions etc.

  Database Handle Attributes:

    AutoCommit          - Boolean. The value may true or false.
    Statement           - String, read-only. Returns the statement string passed to the most recent "prepare" or "do" method called
                          in this database handle, even if that method failed.

  Statement Handle Methods:

    bind_param          - Bind a param to a placeholder embedded in the prepared statement.
    bind_param_array    - Bind an array of values to a placeholder embedded in the prepared statement.

    execute_array       - Execute the prepared statement once for each parameter tuple.
    fetchrow_arrayref   - Fetches the next row of data and returns a reference to an array holding the field values.
    fetchrow_array      - An alternative to fetchrow_arrayref. Fetches the next row of data and returns it as a list containing
                          the field values.
    fetchrow_hashref    - An alternative to fetchrow_arrayref. Fetches the next row of data and returns it as a reference to a hash 
                          containing field name and field value pairs.
    fetchall_arrayref   - Fetches all the data to be returned from a prepared and executed statement handle.It returns a reference
                          to an array that contains one reference per row.
    fetchall_hashref    - Fetches all the data to be returned from a prepared and executed statement handle.It returns a hash 
                          containing a key for each distinct value of the column that was fetched.
    
  Statement Handle Attributes

    rows                - Returns the number of rows affected by the last row affecting command, or -1 if the number of rows is not
